# frozenlink

Generate a frozen link (true permalink) by compressing the content and embedding it in the URL using gzip + base64.

This website just renders the content, and provides a place to generate a link based on arbitrary HTML code.

Purely frontend, no data sent to / from any server. The data is in the URL anchor/fragment, and is not sent to or from the server.
